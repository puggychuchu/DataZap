Iehelper.exe is a file associated with Glary Utilities, a popular system optimization tool developed by Glarysoft Ltd. The version 5.0.0.4 of this executable is generally considered safe, as it is part of legitimate software aimed at improving system performance and maintaining computer health. However, like many executable files, it can sometimes be misidentified by antivirus programs as a potential threat, leading to confusion among users. Errors related to iehelper.exe may arise, typically manifesting as performance issues or crashes, but these are usually linked to problems within the Glary Utilities application itself rather than indicating that the file is malicious. Users are advised to ensure they have the latest version of Glary Utilities installed and to run regular scans with trusted antivirus software to maintain system integrity.
