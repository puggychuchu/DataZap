iisreset.exe is a legitimate executable file associated with Microsoft Windows, specifically designed to manage Internet Information Services (IIS) by allowing users to start, stop, or restart the web server and its associated services. The file is published by Microsoft and has a version number of 6.0.2600.1, which indicates its compatibility with older versions of Windows. As a system utility, iisreset.exe is generally safe to use, provided it is located in the correct directory (typically within the C:\Windows\System32 folder); however, users should be cautious of potential malware disguising itself with the same name, which could lead to security risks. Errors related to iisreset.exe can arise from misconfigurations or issues within IIS, potentially impacting web hosting or application performance if not resolved. In cases where users experience problems, it is advisable to check for the process's integrity and ensure that it is the legitimate Microsoft version before taking any further action.
