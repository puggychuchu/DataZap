idlj.exe is an executable file associated with the iCloud Remover Tool, developed by the iCloud Bypass Team, and is identified as version 7.0.400.43. While it aims to assist users in bypassing iCloud activation locks on Apple devices, its safety is a matter of concern, as such tools often operate in a legal gray area and may expose users to potential risks, including malware or viruses. Users have reported various errors when attempting to run the program, ranging from compatibility issues to system crashes, and it is advised to exercise caution, as the use of bypass tools can lead to unintended consequences, including violation of terms of service. Therefore, while idlj.exe may not be a virus by definition, its legitimacy and safety are questionable, necessitating careful consideration before installation or execution.
